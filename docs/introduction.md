# Introduction

**Cloud.iO** is a scalable **open source** Internet of Things solution licensed under the **MIT license**. It offers an infrastructure to **monitor** and
**control** a huge number of I/O devices from a central cloud platform. cloud.iO can provide both, **real-time** monitoring and control data and **historic**
data storage in a single place. Using state of the art **encryption** and certificate-based **authentication** for all connections (embedded Device Endpoints
and applications accessing the actual data) and offering **flexible access control** mechanisms, cloud.iO is the ideal platform in order to drive your data
acquisition projects on one single platform. Itâ€™s **scalable** architecture allows it to grow with your needs.
